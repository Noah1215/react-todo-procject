!! What I learned !!

1. Context (createContext, useContext, Provider)
- State should be held by the highest parent component in the stack that requires access to the state.
- Unless using context, the top component should pass states as props to the bottom, which is called 'prop drilling'
- UseContext can share state between deeply nested components more easily than with alone.

2. useEffect
- Components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props.
- Using useEffect, components are rendered only once when the components has mounted if empty array is passed as a second argument.
- If passing specific props or state as a second argument, useEffect runs specific logic only when second arguments have been updated.
